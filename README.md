# K-means_Clustering_Analysis_for_Portolio

## Intro
This project is aimed at maximizing profits under fixed risks by using the K-means clustering methods. The superiority of this portfolio lies in the clustering of stocks by using unsupervised learning - k-means, which fits the actual market situation, and thus the hedging portfolio is more convincing.

## Results
(1) Out of the five stocks, only three are actually used, because the other two stocks don't contribute much to the portfolio.Benefits include reduced risk and increased returns.
(2) Since the expected return of the portfolio is a linear combination of five stock returns and the sum of the coefficients is 1, the return of the portfolio (5.782%) will not exceed the highest stock return (8.845%).
(3) The risk (standard deviation) of the portfolio is lower than the risk (standard deviation) of any one stock because of the dependence on the price rise and fall of the five stocks.
(4) The relatively satisfactory relationship table obtained determines that the risk can be greatly reduced through the portfolio.
Although DE Inc has the lowest expected return (-24.871%) in our portfolio, it plays a very important role in reducing risk in the portfolio.
